                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  From May to July 2023, as part of the larger KUHub campus
                  management platform project, I focused on enhancing the
                  dormitory application process for students as a part of the
                  Enterprise Applications Agile Team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We worked in a scrum setting using Jira as our task tool and
                  had daily meetings with product owners and developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the UX & UI Designer, I provided the user flow, and
                  high-fidelity prototype for the project after meeting the
                  stakeholders and interviewing the users. I also conducted
                  usability and satisfaction tests during the design process.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                <p>
                  Improve the dormitory application process for students by
                  enhancing usability, and reducing cognitive load compared to
                  the previous product.
                </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                  I owned the end-to-end UX design for this project, leading
                  research, strategy, and execution. I conducted user
                  interviews, surveys, and usability tests to identify pain
                  points, then translated insights into wireframes and
                  high-fidelity designs in Figma. I ensured WCAG 2.1
                  accessibility compliance and collaborated with developers and
                  product owners in an Agile team to deliver a responsive,
                  user-centred solution.
                </p>

                />
                <h3>UX/UI Methodologies & Techniques</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Client & User Interviews (UX Research)</li>
                  <li>User flow</li>
                  <li>Design systems</li>
                  <li>Cross-team meetings</li>
                  <li>Usability testing</li>
                  <li>UX audit</li>

                  <li>Prototyping</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Tools I Used</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Figma & Figjam</li>
                  <li>Balsamiq</li>
                  <li>Miro</li>
                  <li>Microsoft Forms</li>
                </ul>
                <img
                  src="assets/img/portfolio/06273c37-c52d-4808-a733-974e8cd43ebc_rw_1200.png"
                  alt="Portfolio Image"
                  class="img-fluid"
                  loading="lazy"
                />
                <h4>UX Design Process</h4>
                <p>
                  Once the user flow was finalised, I began developing
                  wireframes in iterative phases. During this process, I
                  assessed the product‚Äôs limitations and identified
                  opportunities for innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The initial wireframes were then presented to a select group
                  of users as part of a UX audit, allowing me to gather valuable
                  feedback. This early user input made the UI design phase much
                  more effective, ensuring the final product was both
                  user-friendly and aligned with our goals.
                </p>
                <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                <p>
                  Using Figma I made a high-fidelity prototype to show the
                  user's interaction with the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The existing KUHub UI kit and Metronic as a framework made the
                  process easier. I incorporated form steppers in the project
                  for a smoother application.
                </p>
                <h4>Testing & Iteration</h4>
                <p>Internal usability testing of components and patterns</p>
                <p>Accessibility testing and adjustments</p>
                <p>Feedback loops from designers and developers</p>
                <p>Iterative updates based on real-world implementation</p>

                        <h4>The Difficulties</h4>
                        <p>
                          I proposed displaying photos of dorm rooms to help
                          students make more informed decisions. However, the
                          development team later rejected this idea due to
                          performance concerns and time constraints, as they
                          couldn't implement an efficient solution before the
                          expected release date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Students with dormitory scholarships have limited room
                          options. To reduce cognitive load, I proposed
                          displaying only the rooms they were eligible to
                          select. However, due to time constraints, the product
                          owners decided to postpone this feature for a future
                          version.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Some of the written content was unclear. I suggested
                          rewriting certain documents and renaming sections‚Äîsuch
                          as "Dormitory Preference Priority"‚Äîto make them more
                          user-friendly, as the original phrasing felt too
                          administrative. However, the client preferred to keep
                          some familiar terms unchanged. Despite this, most of
                          my text suggestions were accepted.

                        <p>
                          During this design process, I conducted interviews
                          with users at the start of the project. I conducted UX
                          Audits during the wireframing and prototyping stages.
                          Usability tests were done throughout the design
                          process with a user satisfaction survey after launch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          During the usability tests, we also discovered that
                          selecting rooms with a drag & drop interaction didn't
                          match the users' needs and there were bugs on the
                          mobile version. I revised the design for a better user
                          experience and developers fixed the bugs.

                        <h4>The Critique</h4>
                        <p>
                          The page where students could read every necessary
                          information for the dormitory application process.
                          Sidebar on the left had two main sections and did not
                          provide enough information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The room selection page where students rank the rooms
                          they want. Numbering on the left often would be
                          confused as the actual ranking. While selecting 3
                          options were enough, this UI made students feel like
                          they have to rank every room type.

                        progress was great. The drag-and-drop system was much
                        better than selecting room numbers one by one."

                        "The room selection was clear and well-organised, making

                    <h4>Final Takeaway</h4>
                    <p>
                      With more time and resources, I would have conducted
                      additional usability tests and incorporated more of my
                      proposed features into the product. While some
                      improvements were planned for future versions, room photos
                      are still missing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This project gave me valuable insights into the product
                      development cycle and significantly strengthened my
                      collaboration skills. I also became more confident in
                      advocating for my ideas and designs‚Äînow, I hear more ‚Äúyes‚Äù
                      and ‚Äúwe will do it‚Äù than before.
